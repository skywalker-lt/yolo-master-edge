## 🔎 1. How and why the MoE internals dictate the deployment strategy

EsMoE-N is not a CNN YOLO like the older v8/v9 variants. There exists three structural priors drove all downstream decisions:

1. **Moixture-of-Experts `ES_MOE`:** At training/inference the router sparsely selects experts. That path already brought us issues earlier in the baseline reproduction task (and was later fixed by `--no-sparse-eval`). It is hence export-hostile (data-dependent control flow), but `ES_MOE.forward` switches to a **dense** unroll under `torch.onnx.is_in_onnx_export()` which is a static loop over the full expert list, `Conv/Pool/Softmax/Mul/Add`, no dynamic dispatch. Crucially, the `--no-sparse-eval` dense path is the **numerically faithful** one. It sidesteps the sparse-inference collapse so exporting *improves* determinism.
2. **Area-attention `A2C2f`:** The backbone carries such transformer-style attn blocks. These reshape activations to `[1, 1600, 192]` internally, which is exactly where the static-shape assumptions of downstream quantizers and tracers break (well discuss it later).
3. **A stride-8/16/32 detection head** (P3/P4/P5) where the classification branch produces raw logits fed through a terminal sigmoid. At 640×640 that is `80^2 + 40^2 + 20^2 = 8400` anchors, matching the exported `[1, 14, 8400]` output (4 box + 10 VisDrone classes). This branch becomes the single most quant sensitive component in the network, for a concrete reason explaiend in Section 3.

The takeaway: the model exports cleanly precisely *because* the dense MoE path is standard ops -- but the attention and the head are landmines for INT8 and for third-party converters.

## 📦 2. Exports

### 2.1 ONNX via onnxsim (opset 12)

Exported to a fully **static** graph, input `images [1,3,640,640]`, output `output0 [1,14,8400]`, 628 nodes, IR 7, and simplified with onnxsim. Opset 12 was chosen carefully for compatibility. It loads unchanged under ORT 1.18 / 1.20 / 1.27 and converts cleanly to *both* NCNN and MNN.

The export emitted shape-inference warning on the attention transpose (`.../attn/Transpose_output_0 source:{1,1600,192} target:{}`, later resolved by ONNXRuntime's lenient merge). ORT resolves the shapes at runtime but they are a **leading indicator**: any tool that requires fully static shape propagation will get choked here (Section 3.5 (MNN quantizer) and 2.4 (coremltools)).

Ultralytics metadata (class names, `imgsz`, `stride`, `task`) is also embedded into the ONNX `metadata_props`, which the C++ runtime reads to auto-configure itself.

### 2.2 NCNN via pnnx

Exported via **pnnx** (PyTorch/ONNX → pnnx IR → ncnn), instead of the legacy `onnx2ncnn`. pnnx preserves higher-level operator semantic and emits a clean graph. The param file was validated: magic `7767517`, **561 layers / 665 blobs**, input blob `in0`, sigmoid-terminated head. A `metadata.yaml` sidecar carries the same names/imgsz so the ncnn path is self-contained, self-describing like the ONNX one.

### 2.3 MNN via mnnconvert

Converted with `mnnconvert` (ONNX → MNN), which emits the exact same graph as ONNX/ncnn, which lets us later check MNN correctness by direct tensor comparison against. (Section 5.3).

### 2.4 Core ML

Core ML export (`coreml_export/export_coreml.py`) exports a **mlprogram** `.mlpackage` carrying the metadata apple-device app reads (`names`, `imgsz`, `output`, `task`, plus `proto`/`nm` for seg models). Conversion can run on **Linux** and only **prediction** requires macOS, which keeps it in the same export environment as others.

Three failure modes had to be closed and are the Section 1 structures reappearing in novel ways:

- **Dynamic shapes → `aten::Int`:** coremltool's torch frontend cannot lower data-dependent integer extraction the attention reshapes produce. Fixed by constant-folding first: `jit.freeze` + `run_frozen_optimizations` resolve the shapes to literals before conversion.
- **MoE telemetry → `aten::copy_`:** The trace died with "No matching select or slice" **not** in the expert compute but in `ES_MOE`'s in-place auxiliaryloss bookkeeping only for training. This is also worth recording as the we may assume that a MoE fails to trace because of routing; here routing was fine and the telemetry was the root cause.
- **Area-attention static shapes:** An eager warmup pass bakes each layer's concrete spatial dimensions so the area reshapes fold to static shapes. For `sunsmarterjie/yolov12` checkpoints (for testing and comparison), `--yolov12-aattn` additionally swaps in the split qk+v attention variant those weights expect.

The script also handles **segmentation** (detects the two-output signature and writes `task=segment` with `proto`/`nm`) and **LoRA fine-tunes** (`--merge-lora-dir` merges adapters before export, since a merged LoRA is a static graph whereas routed MoLoRA cannot be traced).

**Validation:** The Core ML path has **no mAP number**. The macOS app bundles no metric harness, and the `eval_map.py` pipeline used for every other format consumes `--save-txt` output from the C++ runtime, which the Swift app does not produce and it's not added now since Apple's Notarization mendatory for distribution is time-consuming so I decided to bundle the validator **with next major update (Core ML Runner `v1.1.0`).** 

## 🔢 3. INT8 quantization (the substantive part)

The requirement was ≤ 1.0% mAP gap under INT8 with ≥ 300 images for calibration. The naive pipeline *fails*.

### 3.1 The collapse: full INT8 emits nothing

Static per-channel INT8 over the whole graph produces a model that runs, returns the correct output tensor shape, contains **no NaNs**, **and detects nothing**, mAP=0.0000.

Isolating the output tensor shows why: The box-reg channels are intact (`min 0, max 644, mean 210`, matching FP32); however the **classification channels are zero** (`max = 0.0000`, zero scores above 0.001). Hence we ascribe is entirely to the class head.

The mechanism: the class branch emits wide-dynamic-range *logits consumed by a sigmoid. Per-tensor/per-channel MinMax calibration maps that wide range to 256 INT8 levels; the small positive logits that correspond to real detections fall *below one quantization step* and round to a value whose sigmoid is ~0. The non-linearity turns such quantization error on the logits into a coplete signal cut. But box regression, on the other hand, is a smooth linear readout with no saturating nonlinearity downstream, so it tolerates INT8 comfortably. This asymmetry of **robust regression but crushed classification** is the key diagnostic here.

### 3.2 Localizing the sensitivity

After learning the lesson we keep the detection head (`/model.25/`, 85 nodes) in FP32 and quantizing everything else. This recovers the model back to **mAP50-95=0.1924, ∆ −1.12%** vs PyTorch. So the model is functional but still over budget. The remaining loss lives within two quant-sensitive structures:

- **MoE router:** Expert mixing is a softmax over routing logits. INT8 trims the precision of routing weights.
- **Area-attn:** Attention scores pass through a softmax whose output is sensitive to input scale; INT8 on QK path shifts the attention distribution.

Both are the same failure class as the head: **a softmax/sigmoid amplifying a quantization perturbation.** This aligns with LLM quantization stategies. 

### 3.3 The mixed-precision outcome

The fix is node-level precision: keep the three softmax/sigmoid-bearing blocks, head (`/model.25/`), attention (`/attn/`), router (`routing`), **289 nodes** in FP32, INT8 everything else. The progression is diagnostic:

| Configuration | mAP50-95 | Δ vs PyTorch |
|---|---|---|
| Full INT8 | 0.0000 | collapse |
| head FP32 | 0.1924 | −1.12% |
| head + attention + router FP32 | **0.1952** | **−0.84% ✅** |

Final model: **10.9 → 5.4 MB (2.0×)**, mAP50-95 error **−0.84%** meets the 1.0% requirement, as direct consequence of removing quantization from exactly the operators that violate the "smooth, non-saturating" assumption PTQ relies on.

### 3.4 Calibration engineering

Three non-obvious details mattered:

- **Letterbox-matched calibration.** Calibrators default to a plain resize; the model is trained on **letterboxed** input. Calibrating on the wrong preprocessing biases every activation range. We pre-letterbox 300+ VisDrone *train* images (no val leakage) to 640×640 and calibrate on those, so the calibration distribution matches inference exactly.
- **QOperator, and the opset floor.** Per-channel INT8 emits `DequantizeLinear` with an `axis` attribute, which is **only valid at opset ≥ 13**; the opset-12 export must be lifted (we upgrade to 17 in-line) or the quantized model is an invalid graph. QOperator (`QLinearConv`/`QLinearMatMul`) is chosen over QDQ for CPU execution.
- **MinMax over Percentile.** Percentile/entropy calibration builds a histogram per activation tensor; on a graph with hundreds of attention/MoE intermediates × hundreds of images, that is pathologically slow for no accuracy gain here -- the exclusions already remove the outlier-heavy layers, so MinMax on the remaining well-behaved convolutions is both faster and sufficient.

### 3.5 Third-party INT8 toolchains hit the attention wall

MNN's offline quantizer (`mnnquant`) aborts immediately on this model -- `std::length_error: cannot create std::vector larger than max_size()` -- before any calibration runs. The cause is precisely the `[1,1600,192]` attention reshapes flagged in Section 2.1: the quantizer allocates buffers from statically-inferred tensor dimensions, and the dynamically-shaped attention intermediate reads back as a garbage size. MNN executes this graph fine at *inference* (it resolves shapes lazily); its *quantizer* assumes static shapes. This is a limitation of the tool's static-shape contract, not of the model, and it is not configurable. The ONNXRuntime quantizer, which tolerates dynamic intermediates, is the correct vehicle for this architecture.

### 3.6 Where INT8 actually pays off, and where it doesn't

On x86 CPU, INT8 is *slower* than FP32, measured at **137 ms/frame vs 49 ms for FP32 on the same host, ~2.8× slower** (7.2 vs 19.5 FPS; the 40 ms in Section 7 is the canonical 4-thread benchmark on the reference host, so use the paired figures here for the ratio). The QDQ/QOperator kernels don't engage INT8 SIMD paths that beat the well-tuned FP32 convolutions, and the FP32 $\leftrightarrow$ INT8 boundaries around the excluded blocks add conversion overhead. This is expected, not a defect: INT8's throughput win is a property of **INT8 tensor-core hardware**, not of desktop CPUs.

The natural next hypothesis was that tensor-core hardware would invert the result. **It does not, for this model** -- Section 9 shows the calibrated TensorRT INT8 engine on the Orin is both slower and less accurate than FP16, for a structural reason: the mixed-precision assignment keeps the compute-dominant area-attention out of INT8, so INT8 never gets to accelerate the expensive part. The general lesson generalizes past this model: **PTQ's throughput payoff is bounded by the fraction of compute you are allowed to quantize**, and on attention-heavy architectures that fraction is small. We therefore treat the ONNX INT8 result as an **accuracy** proof (−0.84%, in budget), and locate the real throughput win on FP16 GPU execution (Section 6) rather than on INT8 anywhere.

## ⚙️ 4. The inference runtime

### 4.1 Universal binary

One executable (`yolomaster_edge`) with **four backends** (ONNXRuntime, NCNN, MNN, TensorRT) behind a common interface (`backend_factory.hpp`). Backend, class names, and input size are **auto-detected** from the model (`.onnx` → ORT, a directory or `.param` → ncnn, `.mnn` → MNN, `.engine` → TensorRT; metadata read from ONNX `metadata_props` or the ncnn `metadata.yaml` sidecar), so the same binary serves any exported YOLO-Master variant with no recompilation.

```text
--backend  auto | onnx | ncnn | mnn
--device   cpu | cuda | trt | coreml     (ONNX backend; trt/coreml select the ORT EP)
```

Source can be an image, a directory, a video, or a `dataset.yaml`. Sixteen robustness tests (corrupt images, missing files, imgsz mismatch, backend inference, etc.) pass on all platforms (`cpp/run_tests.sh`).

### 4.2 Preprocessing

Aspect-ratio-preserving **letterbox** (min-side scale, 114 padding) → RGB `/255` NCHW, matching training. The letterbox metadata (scale & pad) is threaded through decode so boxes map back to original-image pixel coordinates in float with no intermediate rounding.

### 4.3 Decode, NMS, and the mAP-parity subtlety

An early version of the C++ pipeline read **1.19 mAP points low** despite bit-accurate inference. We found the cause in the decode: ultralytics `val` uses **`multi_label=True`**, one detection per class scoring above threshold per anchor, not a single argmax. Reproducing that (`--multi-label` mode) recovered the gap exactly (0.3375 → 0.3494 mAP50). NMS is **per-class** (`agnostic=False`), implemented with a class-offset trick (shift each box by `class_id × 8192` so cross-class boxes never suppress each other), and capped at 300 detections. Default `conf` is low, appropriate to VisDrone's small/dense objects; `--conf`/`--iou` are tunable per deployment.

### 4.4 Instance Segmentation

The runtime also decodes instance segmentation models. A segmenter emits a second output--the prototype tensor, longside the detection tensor; the exported metadata carries `task=segment` plus `proto`/`nm` so the runtime dispatches on the model. Masks are reconstructed by combining the per-instance mask coefficients with the prototypes cropped to each box and thresholded; the GUI runners composite them anti-aliased to avoid serrated edges.

The shipped default for both GUI runners is **`YOLO-Master-v0.1-seg-N`** (`task: segment`, imgsz 640, stride 32, **COCO-80** classes), exported to ONNX / MNN / ncnn. Note the domain change: the detection results throughout this report are VisDrone 10-class, while the bundled segmenter is COCO-80. **No segmentation mAP is reported** -- the metric harness in Section 5 is detection-only, and extending it to mask AP is future work (Section 11).

### 4.5 Dependency cut for a portable bundle

The first self-contained Linux bundle was **231 shared libraries, 129 MB** since Ubuntu's `libopencv_imgcodecs` links **GDAL**, which transitively pulls in PostgreSQL (`libpq`), MySQL, `libpoppler` (PDF), HDF5, and the GIS stack, and `libopencv_dnn` pulls protobuf. An object detector does not need a Postgres client. We removed both by replacing `cv::imread`/`imwrite` with **stb_image** and `cv::dnn::NMSBoxes`/`blobFromImage` with a hand-written NMS and a manual NCHW pack. That drops the OpenCV surface to **core + imgproc only**: 231 → 10 libraries, **129 → 35 MB**, at a cost of a **0.087%** detection-count difference (stb vs OpenCV JPEG decoders diverge by sub-LSB pixel values on a handful of borderline boxes), inside tolerance. On Linux the binary is `$ORIGIN`-rpath'd and verified to run with no `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`; on Windows the MSVC runtime is bundled so targets need no VC++ Redistributable.

## 📊 5. Accuracy validation

### 5.1 Methodology

Every model (PyTorch, ONNX, NCNN, MNN, INT8, CUDA, Vulkan, OpenCL, TensorRT) is scored through a single path: predictions at **conf 0.001, NMS iou 0.7, multi-label, cap 300** (ultralytics `val` settings), fed to ultralytics' own `DetMetrics` + `box_iou` + `match_predictions` (`eval_map.py`). This guarantees the numbers are comparable across formats and directly comparable to the ultralytics reference. ONNX/ncnn/MNN/GPU predictions are produced by the C++ runtime; the Jetson uses a dependency-free reimplementation of the same harness `eval_map_standalone.py`. Core ML is the one path outside this harness and will be included later (Section 2.4).

### 5.2 Results (548 VisDrone val images)

| Model | Device | mAP50-95 | Δ mAP50-95 vs PyTorch |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PyTorch (reference)** | -- | 0.2036 | -- |
| ONNX | CPU | 0.2034 | **−0.02%** |
| NCNN | CPU | 0.2034 | **−0.02%** |
| MNN | CPU | 0.2034 | **−0.02%** |
| ONNX (CUDA) | H200 SXM | 0.2033 | **−0.03%** |
| ONNX (CUDA) | RTX 5070Ti Laptop | 0.2033 | **−0.03%** |
| NCNN (Vulkan, FP16) | RTX 5070Ti Laptop | 0.2034 | **−0.02%** |
| MNN (OpenCL, FP16) | RTX 5070Ti Laptop | 0.2034 | **−0.02%** |
| TensorRT FP16 | Jetson Orin Nano 4GB | 0.2029 | **−0.07%** |
| INT8 (mixed) | CPU | 0.1952 | **−0.84%** |

All three FP32 CPU export formats land on **identical** mAP (0.2034), as they should with the same graph, at **−0.02%** from PyTorch, 25× inside the 0.5% target. INT8 is **−0.07%**, inside the 1.0% target. (The INT8 mAP50 drop is larger, −1.27%, reflecting slightly softer classification confidences at INT8; the budget is defined on mAP50-95, which passes.)

The GPU rows are the substantive addition since the previous revision, and they carry a non-obvious result (see Section 6).

### 5.3 Numerical parity, isolating format from pipeline

Because the FP32 formats share a graph, we verify fidelity directly rather than only through mAP. Feeding **identical letterboxed inputs** to MNN and the source ONNX across 100 val images yields **max|Δ| = 0.096, mean|Δ| = 9.7e-05** on the raw `[1,14,8400]` output. The max is a single box-coordinate least-significant bit (coordinates run to ~640; 0.096 px is nothing); the mean is negligible. Detection counts over the full set are effectively equal (ONNX 157,464 vs ncnn 157,465 at conf 0.001). This distinguishes *format equivalence* from *coincidentally similar mAP*.

The same discipline caught a **false alarm** on the CUDA path: a raw `max|Δ| = 2.31` looked alarming until it was traced to FP32 box-coordinate variance in a single anchor -- functional mAP was identical. A naive "max-abs-diff < ε" gate would have failed a correct model; the box-vs-class decomposition is what makes the comparison meaningful.

## 🚀 6. GPU acceleration across all three backends

Each backend has a different native accelerator, and the runtime maps a single **Device: CPU / GPU** switch onto all of them: **ONNX → CUDA**, **ncnn → Vulkan**, **MNN → OpenCL**, with ncnn and MNN running **FP16** on the GPU. Every backend falls back to CPU cleanly and surfaces the reason when a provider is unavailable, which matters in a GUI where the user cannot read a stderr log.

Measured on the same 548 VisDrone images, one consumer laptop GPU (Win11):

| Backend | CPU | GPU | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| ONNX → CUDA | 40 ms | **9.0 ms** | 4.4× |
| MNN → OpenCL (FP16) | 74 ms | **19.1 ms** | 3.9× |
| NCNN → Vulkan (FP16) | 80 ms | **20.2 ms** | 4.0× |

Three findings:

**FP16 on the GPU is accuracy-free.** The ncnn-Vulkan and MNN-OpenCL FP16 paths both score **0.2034 mAP50-95 -- identical to their FP32 CPU counterparts**, and CUDA scores 0.2033. This is the sharp contrast with Section 3: half-precision is a *uniform* reduction in mantissa that the softmax/sigmoid structures tolerate, whereas INT8 is a *range-mapping* that the same structures amplify catastrophically. On this architecture FP16 is free and INT8 is not -- which is the practical rule this project ended up deploying by.

**The x86 backend ranking survives the move to GPU.** ORT keeps a ~2× lead over MNN and ncnn on the GPU (9.0 vs 19.1/20.2 ms) much as on CPU (40 vs 74/80 ms), so the earlier expectation that the mobile-first runtimes would close the gap is *not* borne out on desktop NVIDIA hardware. That expectation was about ARM, and it remains untested: the Jetson path went through TensorRT (Section 9) rather than ncnn/MNN, so no ARM-native comparison exists yet.

**The model does not saturate a datacenter GPU.** An H200 SXM (7.8 ms) is only ~15% faster than an RTX 5070Ti Laptop (9.0 ms). At nano scale with a 640×640 input, per-launch overhead and memory traffic dominate, not FLOPs -- so for this model class a consumer GPU is the sensible deployment target and the datacenter part buys almost nothing.

## ⏱️ 7. Latency and throughput

Per-frame inference, VisDrone val:

| Platform | Backend | Device | infer (ms) | FPS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Linux CPU (4-thread) | ONNX (ORT) | CPU | 40.0 | 25.0 |
| Windows 11 CPU | ONNX (ORT) | CPU | 37.6 | 25.4 |
| Linux CPU (4-thread) | MNN | CPU | 74.0 | 13.5 |
| Linux CPU (4-thread) | NCNN | CPU | 80.0 | 12.5 |
| Windows 11 CPU | NCNN | CPU | 80.1 | 12.2 |
| Linux CPU (4-thread) | ONNX INT8 (mixed) | CPU | 137 | 7.2 |
| Linux | ONNX (ORT) | **CUDA / H200 SXM** | 7.8 | **128** |
| Windows | ONNX (ORT) | **CUDA / RTX 5070Ti Laptop** | 9.0 | **111** |
| Windows | MNN | **OpenCL / RTX 5070Ti Laptop** | 19.1 | 52.4 |
| Windows | NCNN | **Vulkan / RTX 5070Ti Laptop** | 20.2 | 49.5 |
| Jetson Orin Nano 4GB | **TensorRT FP16** | Orin iGPU | 27.8 | 35.7 |
| macOS (M4 Max) | **Core ML** | MPS / ANE | 17.4 | 57.4 |

CPU latencies are x86 @ 4 threads on one host. The ordering is consistent and explicable: **ORT is ~2× faster than MNN and NCNN on x86** because it is heavily x86/AVX-tuned, while MNN and NCNN are mobile/ARM-first runtimes; that ordering persists on the GPU (Section 6). **INT8 is the slowest row** for the reasons in 3.6. The Core ML row is latency-only (no mAP, Section 2.4) and is notable for the ratio it implies: an M4 Max at 17.4 ms lands between a consumer GPU and a CPU, on a low power budget.

No single format fits everywhere, which is exactly why we have four distributions below.

## 🌐 8. Cross-platform builds and distribution

A single CMake tree now targets **four platforms**:

| Platform | Toolchain | Backends | Distribution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linux x86_64 | GCC / CMake | ONNX (+CUDA EP), NCNN, MNN | 35 MB `$ORIGIN`-rpath'd tarball, 10 libs, verified isolated |
| Windows 10/11 x64 | VS 2022 / 2026, MSVC 19.5x | ONNX (+CUDA), NCNN (+Vulkan), MNN (+OpenCL) | Self-contained zip, MSVC runtime bundled; lean and CUDA variants |
| macOS 14+ | Swift 5.9+, Xcode CLT | Core ML | Universal (Apple Silicon + Intel) `.app`, Developer-ID signed and **notarized** |
| Jetson Orin (JetPack 7) | aarch64 GCC / CMake | TensorRT (priority), ONNX, NCNN, MNN | aarch64 tarball, OpenCV bundled, TensorRT/CUDA from JetPack |

The Windows port surfaced three concrete portability issues, each fixed in the build system rather than worked around: `Ort::Session` takes `const wchar_t*` on Windows (a platform `ORTCHAR_T` shim); the prebuilt OpenCV config doesn't recognize the VS 2026 toolset and reports an empty runtime (point `OpenCV_DIR` at the concrete `vc16/lib` config); and the exe needs the MSVC runtime on clean targets (bundled via `InstallRequiredSystemLibraries`). SDK locations live in a gitignored `sdk-paths.cmd` rather than in the build scripts, and `.cmd` entry points are provided alongside `.ps1` because PowerShell execution policy blocks the latter on default Windows installs.

The Windows GUI ships in two flavours: a lean bundle that gets GPU inference through ncnn-Vulkan and MNN-OpenCL using only the graphics driver, and a considerably larger CUDA bundle that additionally carries the cuDNN and CUDA runtime libraries for the fastest ONNX path. Neither requires a CUDA toolkit installation on the target. The executable is **not code-signed** (that needs a paid certificate), so SmartScreen warns on first launch; the macOS app, by contrast, is signed and notarized and installs by double-click.

## 🤖 9. Embedded GPU deployment: Jetson Orin

The runtime was taken to a **Jetson Orin Nano 4 GB**. The same CMake produces a native aarch64 binary with a `trt_backend` that deserializes a prebuilt engine and runs it via `enqueueV3`, joining the other backends behind the same interface. The engine is built on-device with `trtexec` from the exported ONNX.

**Result.** The FP16 engine runs at **27.8 ms/frame GPU compute (35.7 FPS)**, and the on-device accuracy over the full 548 VisDrone val set is **mAP50-95 0.2029, ∆ −0.07% vs the PyTorch FP32 baseline** (0.2036), matching the x86 ONNX result to within 0.2 mAP points.

**FP16, not INT8.** Section 3.6 reserved the INT8 *throughput* proof for this path, on the expectation that tensor-core INT8 would invert the CPU result. For this model it doesn'y. The mixed-precision assignment from Section 3 keeps the attn, head, and router in higher precision, so INT8 leaves the compute-heavy area-attention on FP32/FP16 kernels; combined with TensorRT's INT8 being lossier than the ONNXRuntime path, the calibrated INT8 engine measures **0.3202 mAP50 at 21.7 FPS, slower *and* less accurate than FP16**. Where a network's dominant cost is attention that does not quantize, **FP16 is hence the correct embedded target**. Taken together with Section 6, FP16 is the correct target on *every* accelerator tested: it is accuracy-neutral on desktop GPUs and accuracy-cheap on Jetson Orin, while INT8 strugggles.

**Build notes.** Two toolchain specifics are worth recording. On sm87 with TRT 10.16.2 a pure-FP16 build fails at low builder-optimization levels (the timing model references an sm80 shader that has no sm87 base); `--builderOptimizationLevel=3` selects tactics by on-device profiling instead and builds cleanly. And an ONNXRuntime-quantized QDQ model must use symmetric activations and non-quantized bias to be accepted by TensorRT's parser `quantize_int8.py --symmetric`. The Nano 4 GB version also needs swap for the engine *build* (inference itself uses only ~20 MB).

## 💻 10. GUI runners for Windows and macOS

The CLI is the efficient tool for benchmarking and batch work but not friendly for everyone else, especially. Two native GUI runners now sit on the same pipeline.

**macOS -- YOLO-Master CoreML Runner** (v1.0.0-macos). A SwiftUI frontend over Core ML: `YOLOMasterKit` carries the pipeline (preprocess, detect, annotate, image I/O) and the app layer adds camera and UI. Universal binary, Developer-ID signed & notarized, macOS 14+ (the SwiftUI API floor -- `onKeyPress`, zero-parameter `onChange`).

**Windows -- YOLO-Master Windows Runner GUI** (v1.0.0-windows). Native Win32 + Direct3D 11 + Dear ImGui. The important architectural property is that it **compiles the CLI's own runtime sources** (`cpp/common.cpp`, the backend implementations, `stb_impl.cpp`) rather than reimplementing them, so letterbox, decode, per-class NMS, and the class palette are identical to the validated CLI path. Sharing the translation unit is what lets Section 5's mAP table apply to what the user actually runs. It carries all three backends in one executable, switchable at runtime, which makes backend comparison on the same image a single-click operation.

Both frontends share the same interaction model, and two decisions:

- **Forward once, tune cheap.** Confidence, IoU, box style, labels, and letterbox-vs-stretch all redraw from a cached forward pass. Inference never re-runs when a threshold moves, so the controls are usable at interactive rates even where a frame costs 80 ms. Candidates are cached down to a 0.05 confidence floor so lowering the threshold stays instant.
- **Two-phase media handling.** Folders and videos are inferred once with a progress bar, then browsed or scrubbed from cache. A 30 fps clip therefore plays back at 30 fps regardless of model speed, because inference is off the playback path entirely. The webcam path instead infers on a background thread with drop-late-frames, trading completeness for latency.

## 🔖 11. Future work
- **Core ML accuracy validation.** The one backend without an mAP number (Section 2.4). The cheapest route is a `--save-txt`-compatible dump from the macOS app, which drops it straight into the existing `eval_map.py` and makes the Core ML row directly comparable to every other row in Section 5.2.
- **Segmentation metrics.** The harness is detection-only; the bundled `v0.1-seg-N` is validated visually. Mask AP against the COCO protocol would close it.
- **ARM-native backend comparison.** Section 6 leaves the original hypothesis that ncnn and MNN close the gap on ARM -- untested since the Jetson work went through TensorRT. Running the ncnn-Vulkan and MNN-OpenCL paths on the Orin would settle it on the hardware they were designed for.
- **Non-NVIDIA GPUs.** The Vulkan and OpenCL paths should already work on AMD, Intel, and Ascend hardware.
- **Production drone platform (DJI Manifold 3).** VisDrone is aerial/drone imagery, so the natural production target is an onboard drone computer. [DJI Manifold 3](https://enterprise.dji.com/manifold-3) is an **NVIDIA Orin NX-based** enterprise edge computer purpose-built for drones where the exact aarch64 + TensorRT path in Section 9 deploys onto it directly. Validating this pipeline on the Manifold 3 exercises **real-time on-drone inference in operational conditions** (aerial surveillance, infrastructure inspection, search-and-rescue), closing the loop from VisDrone training to production drone edge deployment.
